					<h1>What is Wolframe ?</h1>
					<p>Technically speaking, Wolframe is a modular 3-tier application server framework.</p>
					<p>Wolframe started as idea in 2008. At that time we wanted an application server that would be easily
					configured as an ERP, CRM or similar system. The emphasis here is <b>configured</b>. Time has passed,
					ideas got refined, emphasis changed and the project started in January 2011.
					Now, the goals and the requirements were more clearly defined. The system should run natively on many
					platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OSX, BSDs), should obey the system rules and should not annoy neither
					system administrators, the application administrators or the users. Also its security
					should be, at least, at the industry level.</p>

					<h1>A wide range of applications</h1>
					<p>The type of applications that can be built using Wolframe can vary greatly. Althougth the initial
					focus was on only a limited number of applications, today Wolframe can handle a much wider range as
					most of the built-in functionality is application agnostic.
					<p>The modular architecture of Wolframe allows the system to be extended with new languages
					for the business logic layer, new SQL database drivers, new types of inputs and many others.</p>

					<h1>Just build the solution</h1>
					<p>The main goal is to have a system that allows the developer to build an application
					with as little effort as possible. When developing a Wolframe application the main activity should be
					analysing the problem. The built-in functions and structures and the user defined ones are then connected
					together in a direct way in oreder to form an application.</p>
					<p>Building the Wolframe application should be a straight path.</p>

					<h1>Work well spent</h1>
					<p>Adopting of Wolframe as the development framework is painless. The database layer is based on the
					native SQL of the underlying database, the business logic uses standard languages, you can mix everything
					with everything. Developers can reuse code, arrange elements in libraries and extend functionality of their
					previous code.</p>
					<p>Most important there is no magic involved here, everything is transparent, so the learning curve is
					smooth and understanding a system is easy.</p>
