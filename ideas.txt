Main text on landing page:

Wolframe started as idea in 2008 and as a project in January 2011.
The motivation was to build an application server that obeys system rules,
has transparent processing and development and is accepted in sensible environments.

Obeying system rules means
The system (database, rights management, etc.) exists. An application 
is built to work with the system and not as a parallel universe.

Transparency means
Not to build magic, because magic is a beast hard to control.
Reduction of complexity is archieved by simplicity instead.

Usable in a sensible environments means:
Security is ensured by .... (some catchy thing here)
using standard encryption methods that are up to date.



... more (Transaparency)
Wolframe processing and development is transparent because in the whole processing 
of a users operation there is no step involved that is not explicitely defined by
the configurator.
Wolframe does not use techniques of automation that merge multiple 
aspects of the system. The idea is that the additional effort that 
has to be put into a system when not using for example complex code generation 
can be compensated with simplicity. Simplicity is paying off in bigger systems
when you compare it to intransparent automation.
Simplicity is archieved in Wolframe with building blocks that have a clear definition
and scope and can be combined together in a natural way.
