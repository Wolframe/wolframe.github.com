Main text on landing page:

Wolframe started as idea in 2008 and as a project in January 2010.
The main motivation was to build an application server that obeys system rules and
has transparent processing and development.

Obey System Rules:
Wolframe obeys system rules because the system is not defined by Wolframe.
There is no parallel universe built. The system (database, rights management, etc.) 
is given and a Wolframe application is built to work with the system.

Transaparency:
Wolframe processing and development is transparent because in the whole processing 
of a users operation there is no step involved that is not explicitely defined by 
the configurator. There is no magic involved because magic is a beast that is hard to control.

Security:
Wolframe uses standard encryption methods that are up to date to ensure safe communication.


... more (Transaparency)
Wolframe does not use techniques of automation that merge multiple 
aspects of the system. The idea is that the additional effort that 
has to be put into a system when not using for example complex code generation 
can be compensated with simplicity. Simplicity is paying off in bigger systems
when you compare it to intransparent automation.
Simplicity is archieved in Wolframe with building blocks that have a clear definition
and scope and can be combined together in a natural way.
